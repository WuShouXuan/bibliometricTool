To demonstrate the capabilities of Industry 4.0, MTC (Manufacturing Technology Centre) from the UK developed a rapidly deployable, remotely managed, modular manufacturing supply chain network enabled by industrial digital technologies called Factory in a Box. This is a rapid route to market for products with a faster return on investment on its manufacturing innovation and new disruptive business models for the supply chain [15]. Government funding bodies are also not far behind and are offering substantial funds for researching supply chain [15]. Government funding bodies are also not far behind and are offering substantial different facets of Industry 4.0. A project funded by the European Union (EU) titled “GrowIn 4.0” funds for researching different facets of Industry 4.0. A project funded by the European Union (EU) aims to identify barriers to the uptake of Industry 4.0 in SMEs and propose different management titled “GrowIn 4.0” aims to identify barriers to the uptake of Industry 4.0 in SMEs and propose related tools for ease of transformation [16]. Another project funded by the European Union along different management related tools for ease of transformation [16]. Another project funded by the the same lines is “SME 4.0” that focuses on identifying Industry 4.0 enablers, developing SME-specific European Union along the same lines is “SME 4.0” that focuses on identifying Industry 4.0 enablers,; Funding text 2: Since the theme of this paper is to highlight the interconnectedness of different Industry 4.0 technologies with AM, therefore, there are two aspects to be considered i.e., autonomous robots undertaking 3D printing operations and 3D printing supporting robotics. The former has been discussed and literature related to the latter is presented here. To take full advantage of the autonomous robots, several future-focused Danish companies (GXN Innovation, 3XN, Danish AM Hub, and Map Architects) collaborated on an initiative called “Break the Grid.” They envisage fleets of roaming 3D-printers moving across the land, air, and even sea. They are developing three different concept designs to address three separate use-cases. All of them autonomously scan the environment, identify problem areas, and act to fix them. The 3D-printing robots can perform a multitude of activities ranging from new manufactures to repairs to detecting damages and surveillance [108]. British Robotics Lab, University of York, Edinburgh Napier University and the Free University of Amsterdam received over £1 million in funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for the development of a purpose-designed 3D printing system, dubbed the “birth clinic’, to print small mobile robots. The four-year project is called autonomous robot evolution (ARE) and is aimed at exploring new design approaches for robotics operating in foreign and extreme environments [109]. Working on the ARE project, Hale et al. [110] introduced a robot fabricator in their work aimed at the creation of both virtual and physical robots with evolving brains and bodies. They proposed the idea of 3D printing robot bodies with prefabricated actuators and sensors autonomously attached in the positions determined by evolution and evolutionary algorithms. These highlight the usage of AM in conjunction with other digital aspects requiring data collection, processing, and storage to show the robots working with AM. The digital information gathered by the sensors is processed and acted upon by the robots without human interference to show its autonomous behavior for different applications.","Kagermann H., Wahlster W., Helbig J., Recommendations for implementing the strategic initiative Industrie 4.0: Final report of the Industrie 4.0 Working Group, Acatech München, 8, pp. 19-26, (2013); Lasi H., Fettke P., Kemper H.G., Feld T., Hoffmann M., Industry 4.0, Bus.

[31] state that Industry 4.0 concept is rooted in digital technologies implementation [28]. When mastered, the Industry 4.0 technologies support Smart Manufacturing practices. Thus, according to Frank et al. [31], Smart Manufacturing is part of the front-end technologies cluster. Smart Manufacturing is supported by previously mentioned base-technologies like industrial IoT, big data, cloud, and data analytics. The middle technologies embedded in Smart Manufacturing are: vertical integration technologies (sensors, actuators, PLC/SCADA, MES, ERP, M2M), virtualization technologies (processes simulation, digital twin use, algorithms and tools based on AI), automation technologies (M2M, robots/co-bots), traceability and flexibility technologies (flexible and autonomous lines, additive manufacturing, RFID, GPS, PEID), energy management technologies (smart grid).; Funding text 2: This work is financed by Portuguese national funds through FCT?Funda??o para a Ci?ncia e Tecnologia, under the project UIDB/05422/2020.","Kagermann H., Helbig J., Hellinger A., Wahlster W., Recommendations for Implementing the Strategic Initiative INDUSTRIE 4.0: Securing the Future of German Manufacturing Industry, (2013); Thoben K.-D., Wiesner S., Wuest T., Industrie 4.0 and smart manufacturing—a review of research issues and application examples, Int.

The DI2E toolset includes the Altassian JIRA, an issue tracking service used for agile product development, and Altassian Confluence, a document and wiki creating shared space that can be built out and customized for individual teams. JIRA facilitates the Agile development by having sophisticated Agile tools like Kanban and Scrum boards along with Sprint capabilities. The environment allows for teams to parse out work and track it on a singular platform. Confluence was used for data sharing, artifact publishing, and metrics tracking. We used it to incrementally publish static pictures of architecture artifacts created for AF DCGS. The JIRA and Confluence tool suite helped teams collaborate and share data – however, using Confluence to publish architecture artifacts exposed the architecture views, but limited visibility to and the full utility of the digital system model because users were unable to navigate the full set of data included in the digital thread on Confluence.","Digital Engineering Initiatives, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense – Systems Engineering [ODASD(SE)], (2017); Digital Engineering Transformation across the Department of Defense, (2017); Zimmerman P., A Review of Model-Based Systems Engineering Practices and Recommendations for Future Directions in the Department of Defense, 2nd Systems Engineering in the Washington Metropolitan Area, Chantilly, VA, 03 April, (2014); Digital Engineering Working Group, (2016); Digital Engineering Transformation across the Department of Defense, (2017); Digital Engineering Transformation across the Department of Defense, (2017); Brown J.M., Operating the Distributed Common Ground System: A Look at the Human Factor in Net-Centric Operations, Air & Space Power Journal; Digital Engineering Transformation across the Department of Defense, (2017); Scaled Agile Framework.
